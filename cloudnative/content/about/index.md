## About Us

Welcome to our About Us page. Here you can learn more about our mission and vision.


## What is the cloud?

Cloud computing is the delivery of various services through the internet. These resources are stored on servers in data centers across the globe.

- Resources are components or microservices that make an application.
- When you access a website that is a cloud-native application, a request is made to the cloud server.
- The resources are then compiled and sent back to your device. This means that very little of your hardware is used to run and display the application as the application is running on a remote cloud server.

## How cloud technology impacts you

Cloud native technology has positively transformed our digital world, enabling faster load times, seamless data synchronization across devices, and effortless information sharing.

Understanding proprietary software is important because it is closed-source, restricting users' access to its code, and limiting modifications and distribution.

Embracing open-source solutions fosters innovation, data security, and the collective betterment of technology for everyone, empowering a brighter digital future.

## What is Open Source?

Open Source is computer code all users can inspect, modify and enhance. Because it’s ‘open’, you can own it, create, and innovate.

At its core, open source embraces and celebrates principles of open exchange, collaboration, transparency, and community-oriented development. The result is more than just tech, but a unique way of interacting with one another to innovate solutions and shape the world around us for the better.

## Unlocking Possibilities: Embrace Open Source and Cloud Native Technology

Open source + Cloud native technology allows for more inclusive and trusted infrastructure. By understanding the core mechanics of software engineering and cloud infrastructure, you can use these tools with confidence and understanding, whilst contributing to a global movement that affects our daily lives.

There are still large problems that need solving with the technology we consume and create, and we need keen and inspired minds to join us on this journey.
